# EuroGEST Dataset

This is the GitHub repository for the paper [EuroGEST: Investigating gender stereotypes in multilingual language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03867). 

Our dataset and dataset card is now hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/utter-project/EuroGEST).

This repository includes:
1. Scripts for using the dataset for model testing (under review and to be updated shortly) 
2. A csv containing the prompt scaffolds we use for testing gender-neutral sentences in each language in the dataset 
3. A csv file documenting the numbers of sample sentences available per language per stereotype.  
  

# GEST Dataset
The original GEST dataset, which this work builds on, is from [Women Are Beautiful, Men Are Leaders: Gender Stereotypes in Machine Translation and Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18711) by Matúš Pikuliak, Andrea Hrckova, Stefan Oresko and Marián Šimko ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/kinit-sk/gest/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file)). 


## Dataset creation 
Code for translation of GEST dataset to be released shortly.

## Model evaluation
Instructions to be provided shortly.
